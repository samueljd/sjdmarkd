<span id="_heading=h.gjdgxs" class="anchor"></span>***1.1 CORONAVIRUS***

-   A novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan , a city in Hubei province of China in December 2019 . Since its identification , it has spread rapidly , prompting WHO to declare it as a public health emergency in January 2020 and characterized it as pandemic in March 2020 .

-   COVID 19 is the infection

-   The virus causing it is designated as Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV-2 ) .

***SARS COV-2***

-   SARS CoV â€“ 2 is a betacoronavirus in the same subgenus as Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS ) virus (which caused a rapidly progressive respiratory illness in 2003 and which spread to multiple countries ).

-   Full-length genome sequences show 79.6% sequence identity to SARS-CoV and 96% identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus , while Middle East Respiratory respiratory syndrome (MERS ) virus ( which caused another rapidly progressive respiratory illness in 2012 ) appears more distantly related.

-   The virus uses the receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2 ) for cell entry.

-   It appears that Bats are the primary source, however whether it was transmitted directly or through an intermediate host is not known.
