-   Symptoms usually arise approximately 4 â€“ 5 days after exposure and are mild in 80 % of the patients and includes fever, fatigue and dry cough. Symptoms like rhinorrhea and sore throat are less common

-   Dyspnea affects 30 to 40 % of patients and develops 5 to 8 days after the onset of symptoms. Progression to Acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) can be rapid. Thus onset of dyspnea is an important warning to have the patient admitted and managed further in a hospital setting.

-   Pneumonia and ARDS are the manifestations of severe disease . ARDS is associated with cytokine release syndrome manifested clinically by fever, progressive hypoxia, hypotension and elevated inflammatory markers.

-   According to epidemiological data provided by Chinese CDC in approximately 44,500 confirmed cases following was the spectrum of disease manifestation :

| Spectrum                                                                           | Percentage |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| Mild ( no or mild pneumonia )                                                      | 80 %       |
| Severe Disease ( with dyspnea ,hypoxia , or &gt;50 % lung involvement on imaging ) | 15 %       |
| Critical Disease ( respiratory failure ,Multi organ dysfunction , Shock )          | 5 %        |
